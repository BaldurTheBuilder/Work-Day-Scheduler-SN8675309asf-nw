# Work-Day-Scheduler-SN8675309asf-nw
## Description
This project is an exercise in using third party API's such as jQuery and day.js. The website uses day.js to display the current day and time, and uses this to color-code the day planner in real time. Additionally, the page has interactive text fields and buttons that can save entered tasks to local storage, and reload them when the page is visited again.
